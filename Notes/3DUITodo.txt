-Wait a little bit before hooking up the rest of the game. I want to concern myself with UI animations and layout mainly 
for now.
-We will have test keys / buttons to test certain animations (like drawing a card)

TODO Next

	-Hover animation / functionality
	-Attack animation


(First Step)
-Do general outline of 3D Layout [DONE]
	-Just use sprites for every for now.
	-Should be able to get the general layout down.
	-Avatar
	-Mana
	-Items
	-Hand
	-Lanes
	-Cards
	-Graveyard

	

-Animations
		-Attack 
		-Drawing a card
		-Spell damage
		-Destroying
		-Winning the game
		-Summoning a Unit / Item
		-Triggered Ability source?
-Drag and Drop
	-dragging and dropping should finish on mouse up, not when clicking again
	-dragging and dropping into a droppable area should set the card as a child of that area
-3D Card Prefab
	-Show back boolean (flips the card, only shows the back)
-3D Deck Prefab	
	-Stack cards [DONE]
	-Able to reveal top card of deck (if necessary)
-3D Graveyard Prefab
	-Stack cards [DONE]
	-How are we going to play cards from the graveyard (special case, we will keep the click logic in tact. 
-Highlights
	-UI Entities are highlightable and each one should have its own highlight thingy? (shader??)
-Research 
	-How to do a scrollable area in 3D. 
	-Look into clearing depth flags like that article we found (find url for article again)
	-Worst case scenario we re-use our popups that we had in our 2D view temporarily.


3D Models (or sprites)
	-Avatar Container
	-Items Container
	-Lanes
	-Mana Container
	-Mana Spheres
	-Attack / Activated ability buttons

	
-Hooking up to game controller
	-Might need to change the selection logic slightly to account for drag and drop
	-Spells with targets / units will be "selected" on drag start
	-Spells without targets / units will be "selected" on drag end (will require a drag onto the general game area in order to play)

-Do general outline of 3D Layout
	-Just use sprites for every for now.

	-Items
	-Hand
	-Lanes
	-Cards
	-Graveyard
-Animations
		-Attack 
		-Drawing a card

-3D Card Prefab
	-Show back boolean (flips the card, only shows the back)
-Highlights
	-UI Entities are highlightable and each one should have its own highlight thingy? (shader??)
-Research 
	-How to do a scrollable area in 3D. 
	-Look into clearing depth flags like that article we found (find url for article again)
	-Worst case scenario we re-use our popups that we had in our 2D view temporarily.
	
-Hooking up to game controller
	-Might need to change the selection logic slightly to account for drag and drop
		-Spells with targets / units will be "selected" on drag start
		-Spells without targets / units will be "selected" on drag end (will require a drag onto the general game area in order to play)
